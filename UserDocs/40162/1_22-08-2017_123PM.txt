Q1
27Q

1) Creation of new methods within Service as need to make new ones for general SendTrans with return value to make sure no duplicacy



Need to implement new way of coding of buttons on all pages. So need to create new dynamic buttons and to place those or associate those with the vtypes again.



Points Left:
1) Menu for T00 Forms from Admin where no listing is there
2) Service of Saving not working on 202
3) Redirection Policy: TDSUploading Project + Directory Creation for temp user for further usage

We can create a centralized service for the development purpose in order to combine all projects and get rid of their own personal dlls

Pages to do internal coding like File Creation/Downloading after clicking to menu directly needs to have some option in the project too.


1) Dynamic Button Generic Implementation over Salary Page
2) Main to Salary Page to generically allot the first VType to open



All Actions on all pages will be worked out using Dynamic Buttons instead of page types. (i.e. IsMaster=1,2,0). Action on that specific page will be decided by the Dynamic buttons.

Admin - Too -> Working now for creating a form with Saving using sendtrans by using extra features.

Dropdown inside Gridview problem: dropdown index change causes all the dropdowns to lost the values.

SendTransData -> get this procedure done without any bit basis where we needed to always send a bit during procedure call to say whether we want to Add/Update the data.
